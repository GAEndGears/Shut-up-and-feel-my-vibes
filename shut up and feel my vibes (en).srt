1
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's go

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,600
Don't just take your clothes off! You're quite a moron, aren't you?

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,000
I've lost my drive, thanks to you. Good night then

4
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,500
Girls shouldn't be smoking

5
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,800
Your skirt is too short

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're on your period? Your mouth would be fine then!

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm not your doll you know!

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,700
You look better in these

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,600
Why don't you stay here tonight?

10
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,300
Then get on top of me!

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,800
just shut up already!

12
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,700
Don't just take your clothes off, do it more sexily!

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Can I put my fingers in from behind? Then let me lick you!

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,900
You're reading too much of those magazines, you moron!

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,900
Hey, when are you going to be squirting?

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,500
...Shut up! SHUT UP!

17
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,000
Just shut up and lie down naked

18
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,400
You're actually quite handsome if you don't open your mouth, you know?

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,900
So do you really get why I'm angry?

20
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,000
...why would you actually shut your mouth at this moment? Good night then.

21
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,100
Could you lend me those underwear that you were just wearing?

22
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,100
Could I touch your body? Lower parts in specific?

23
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,300
I can't take it anymore. Let's go to a hotel

24
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,300
...It's not that I'm feeling hesistant

25
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Stay with me as long as tomorrow continues

26
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,600
I love you

27
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,400
Thanks for always being there for me

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,300
I just want those typical lines from you.

29
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,600
It's the good part right now, so can you leave that until later?

30
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,600
Don't worry, you look good in anything

31
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,800
It's almost as if your computer is your lover, huh?

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
When are you going to turn this way? hey?

33
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,000
Look at me!!

34
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,700
If you continue to be like that, I'm going to hate you for real, you know?

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,500
I'm not a girl who could be smiling though everything.

36
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,700
There you go again. Are you really listening to me?

37
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,600
Don't just embrace me without a word...!

38
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:06,000
The time we had a fight over our different opinions of a boring movie...

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
When a drama's love scene made an awkward atmosphere

40
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,800
And the time my heart throbbed when our eyes met, before we started dating

41
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,200
You always embraced me without a word

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,600
I always, always end up forgiving you since I love you after all,

43
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,700
but I also want some kind words from you once in a while.

44
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,000
What exactly is that mouth of yours there for?

45
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,500
To kiss you?

46
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,600
...shut up! Shut up! Shut up! SHUT UP!

47
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,000
Just shut up and lie down naked

48
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,900
You don't have to say anything; I'm going to satisfy you

49
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:06,000
I wonder myself why I had to fall for such a hopeless guy...?

50
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,700
And you embrace me again without a word, oh my heartbeat!
